catagory of trees
compare and contrast min and max heap
binary heaps- 
-no relationship with L and R like in binary search tree. 
-heaps are as compact as possible, all children of each node are full before moving down. 
-at most 2 children. 

maxBinaryHeap- 
-all children are smaller than parent
-no guarantees between children
-left children filled out first 
minBinaryHeap- all children are larger than parent

Binary heaps useful for sorting, an dimplementing priority queues
Binary heaps are either MaxBinaryHeaps or MinBinaryHeaps with parents either being smaller or larger than their children

search o(n)
insertion o(log n)
